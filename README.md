# music_library
This is my first project created completely on my own. 
It is a music library intended to help music directors or music librarians keep track of selections in their library. 
Being a former music teacher, hopefully this is a step up from the Excel document I used to keep track of my library.

The functionality:
1 - User can save each piece to two separate json data files, one that files by title of the music, the other by composer.
2 - Information saved is Title, Composer, File Number, Style/Level of piece, and date last performed.
3 - User can also search for a piece by either Title or Composer and all relevant information will be retrieved.

Things I wish to eventually improve:
1 - I can adapt the information saved pretty easily, depending on the needs of the user. I can also include other forms of search if necessary, 
which means adding more json files to save to. Alternatively, I can learn to provide a way to save all information to one file and make it 
searchable by any provided infomration.
2 - I want to create a web page which will include registration with password so information will be protected (even though it is not that valuable).
3 - I also wish to design the web page so it looks cool, which means learning more about HTML and CSS.
